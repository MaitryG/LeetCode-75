    /* Had Lab today in which we were given to create a data structure which had
    a singly linked list and a doubly linked list. The singly linked list consisted of controlling nodes
    which were connected to two nodes from the doubly linked list.

            10 ----> 90 ----> 32 ----> 23 ----> 21 ----> null
           /  \     /  \     /  \     /  \     /  \
          3 <->2<-> 4<-> 4<->3<->1<->3<->33<->33<->34<->null

    Had to perform the following operations:
    1.) Create this structure
    2.) Display the elements in this form:
        10 | 3 2
        90 | 4 4
        32 | 3 1
        23 | 3 33
        21 | 33 34
    3.) addAtStart
    4.) Find Parent Value
    5.) Find Value of Parent Before my parent
    6.) Insert a new node after my parent
